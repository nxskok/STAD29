Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2020-02-09 14:30: even though there is no assignment due, I will still be in BV 498 on Monday at 4, in case you have any questions for me about the material covered during my absence.

- 2020-02-09 14:00: I also have an [early draft](a6.pdf) of Assignment 6, which will be due on March 10 (ie. after the midterm). This will gain a question on MANOVA and/or repeated measures, which we will probably see the week after reading week. I have to decide whether the material in Assignment 6 is on the midterm or not. I'll let you know about that. (If it is not, it will *certainly* be on the final. Be warned.)


- 2020-02-09 13:30: I had some more email from students making the reasonable point that if last week's second hour goes up on Monday, as it will, that is not enough time to complete even the shortened assignment 5 by Tuesday night. So I am 
giving you an extension on Assignment 5. Extending it by one week will take us into reading week, so Assignment 5 will now be due on *February 25*. Count yourselves lucky. In compensation for that, we go back to two questions (I might even go to three, depending on how far we get in class this week). Watch Nnenna's second hour of lecture (up on Monday) to prepare yourself for question 2, and the first hour of my lecture this week will prepare you for question 3. [Here](a5.pdf) are things as they stand now. 

- 2020-02-08 17:15: OK, so I think I am sorted out. Here is the now shortened [Assignment 5](a5.pdf) with only one question, up on Quercus. The last two parts are about simple effects; if you haven't done those yet, *let me know* and I'll move those off assignment 5 (and onto the beginning of assignment 6, which would then have three questions, the first being short). Here also is a [draft Assignment 6](a6.pdf). It's difficult to coordinate a course when you're not teaching it! Let's hope that we can get organized this week.

- 2020-02-08 16:45: I just checked the WebOption page for our course, and "Lecture 5", from Wednesday, is only one hour long. Since we have not reached the material on analysis of covariance yet, I will move that question from assignment 5 to assignment 6, so your
assignment this week only has one question on it, and I now have a draft assignment 6 that I can post. (The questions on assignment 6 will be doable after this week's lecture, as plans stand now.) I *hope* that you can manage the batteries question, which includes simple effects; this material is slides 285--289 of the lecture notes. (I apologize for getting out of sync, if I have.)

- 2020-02-07 15:30: I met with Nnenna this afternoon to hear about where she was at with you. She finished at 3 last Wednesday (because she had to go downtown)
and so the lecture that's up is only one hour long. She will be recording the second hour today. The second hour includes analysis of covariance, which appears in question 3 of the current assignment. This is supposed to go up tonight, so I will leave it on the assignment for now. If it turns out not to go up tonight, I will move it to the next assignment. (For those wanting a head start on this stuff, look at pages 276--290 of the lecture notes.) I plan to skip the stuff on equivalence and noninferiority, and kick off next week with contrasts, page 306. 

- 2020-02-06 10:30: my [solutions to Assignment 4](a4.pdf).

- 2020-02-06 10:00: the [corrected assignment 5](a5.pdf) with the proper link to the batteries data is up on Quercus. I am keeping an eye on whether you will have a fair chance to work on question 3 (I know you only had a one-hour lecture) and will postpone it to a future assignment if I think you won't have enough time to think about it.

- 2020-02-06 09:45: back home (and, somewhat, awake). I made a mistake with the batteries data file in the current assignment: the correct link is [here](batteries.txt). I will fix up the assignment file on Quercus shortly.

<p> Aside: while I was in England and posting here, I had to remember to subtract five hours from the time there when I typed the timestamps! That explains the early morning timestamps on some of them. I don't *actually* get up that early!

- 2020-02-04 12:00: Nnenna has another commitment later in the afternoon downtown tomorrow, so her plan is to lecture for *one* hour tomorrow, and then video-record the second hour later. I will pick up next week from wherever she gets to.

- 2020-02-04 11:55: the issue with `dplyr` on R Studio Cloud seems to have been fixed. (I successfully installed the whole tidyverse on a new project there, using dodgy
English hotel wifi, so if it works there, it should work for you.)


- 2020-02-03 11:00: I (Ken) will be back next week. Booked my flight back today.

- 2020-02-03 10:55: draft [Assignment 5](a5.pdf), to be doable after Wednesday's class. Let me know if it isn't.

- 2020-02-03 06:45: my [lecture notes](slides_d29.pdf) had some things off the side for predictions with survival analysis. This has now been fixed. The slides now numbered 219--221 might give you a hint for the assignment. 
- 2020-02-01 11:48: if you are in the habit of starting a new project for each assignment, you might run into trouble doing that this time, 
since there is an issue with installing `dplyr` at the
moment (`dplyr` is part of the tidyverse). This usually happens when there is a new version of the package. Until R Studio Cloud obtains a "cached" copy of it (at which point it will install properly), it has to install it from source code, which means compiling some C code, except that `dplyr` is big, so it won't work. The fix for now is to create a new notebook in one of your old projects,
one in which you successfully installed the `tidyverse`. I apologize if this messes up your organization. (I used to suggest creating a new project for each piece of work, but maybe it's better to have one project called Assignments and have a new *notebook* in there for each assignment.)


- 2020-01-31 11:00: my [solutions to assignment 3](a3.pdf).

- 2020-01-31 10:55: I made a small error on [Assignment 4](a4.pdf) which may confuse you when you do it. Use these slightly-modified questions 
(also going up instead of the previous file of questions on Quercus).

- 2020-01-30 07:00: my solutions to assgt 3 taken down temporarily; will go back up later.

- 2020-01-30 06:00: assignment 3 is now closed, and assignment 4 is now up (on the material in yesterday's class). 
Remember what I said in C32: don't expect assignments to be extended because you cannot access software: *it is up to you to allow enough time*. The first problems on `rstudio.cloud` were noted midday on January 28. If you leave an assignment until late, you are *gambling* that you will be able to finish it in time. For the next assignment, *start it early* (you have everything now that you need to do it), and be prepared to *use R Studio on your own computer*. The instructions for that are [here](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf), starting at page 31.

- 2020-01-28 17:00: I am hearing about R Studio outages, and I cannot connect myself. We'll allow assignment 3's to reach us up to 6:00pm tomorrow. I'll put up my solutions after that.

- 2020-01-28 08:30: I am temporarily in England. Nnenna Asidianya will be teaching in my absence. Keep an eye on Quercus for announcements from her.

- 2020-01-22 16:15: Assignment 3 is up on Quercus, due next week Tuesday. 

- 2020-01-22 12:50: scheduled midterm time is Saturday, February 29, 2020	17:00-19:00	in SW309.


- 2020-01-22 12:45: [My solutions to assignment 2](a2.pdf)

- 2020-01-21 16:30: on the agenda this week: logistic regression with a more-than-two-category response, for example high-medium-low rather than yes-no. There are two variations, depending on whether the response categories are ordered or not.

- 2020-01-21 16:25: draft [Assignment 4](a4.pdf), part of which I expect you'll be able to do after this week's lecture. Also long (sorry), but I wanted to make sure you had practice with as much as possible, to reduce the chance of surprises on the exams.

- 2020-01-20 22:30: first draft of [Assignment 3](a3.pdf), the first two questions of which you can do now. Yes, this is rather long, but you just had a short one. I am now working on assignment 4 (trying to stay ahead).

- 2020-01-19 17:00: tutorial, um, "practical", tomorrow for [Assignment 2](a2.pdf). 
I am working on Assignment 3, which is horrifically long (it has three questions to hand in right now, but I may shift one of them to assignment 4.)



- 2020-01-15 12:15: [My solutions to assignment 1](a1.pdf).

- 2020-01-15 11:15: on the agenda today: some more regression stuff, with some old ideas and some new ones; the start of logistic regression.

- 2020-01-15 11:00: a short [Assignment 2](a2.pdf), due next week. (It was longer, but I realized I might not get to everything in the original Assignment 2 today, so some of it is deferred to Assignment 3, which you can expect to be longer.) The question is on a "simple" logistic regression.

- 2020-01-13 15:50: the references to PASIAS in question 3 of assignment 1 appear to be to the wrong chapter, since they are meant to be practice for regression! Change chapter 13 to chapter 14, and you should be good.


- 2020-01-08 23:30: I spent too much of the evening cracking the problem with the lecture notes, but I think it is now fixed.

- 2020-01-08 16:30: [Assignment 1](a1.pdf) is good to go. Hand in questions 2 and 4. I am about to put it up on Quercus.

- 2020-01-08 16:25: I had a bit of trouble with the lecture notes. Now (finally) fixed.

- 2019-12-31 13:30: We get right down to business. Week 1's lecture will look at dates and times, and some regression stuff (beyond what we did in C32). 
Assignment 1 is based on the first lecture, and will be due the following Tuesday. Here is the
draft [Assignment 1](a1.pdf). As usual, if we don't get as far as all of that, I'll move what we don't look at in week 1 to a later assignment. 

- 2019-12-31 13:30: **For those taking STA 1007**: make sure you have access to R before we start. This could be having R installed on your computer, or having an account on R Studio Cloud. Pages 18--30, or pages 31--41, of [this](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf) will help. (Pick one.) It would also be good to follow along with [this](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/a0.pdf) and make sure you get the same things I did. Looking further ahead, the students in STAD29 have previously taken my course STAC32, so you might find [my C32 R lecture notes](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf) helpful. (That is, the same document from which the R access instructions came.) I am open to having R catchup sessions as necessary after lecture (if I have any voice left) for STA 1007 folks who need them. 

- 2019-12-29 15:35 edited 2020-01-08 10:45: lectures start in week 1 (January 8) and run Wednesdays 14:00-16:00 in HW 215. "Practicals" start in week 2 (January 13) and are Mondays 16:00-17:00 in BV 498. The practicals are like the tutorials in C32: I have booked a computer lab and I will be there to help with anything course-related. I also have "ordinary" office hours in IC 471, on Wednesday morning. The idea is if you have questions about the assignment, raise them in practical; if you have questions about the course material, ask me after class or in office hours. If you can't make it to the practical, I might also be available Monday afternoon after 13:00.

  - If you are taking STA 1007, it helps if you know some R, but I will help you get up to speed if needed. I'd like it if you introduce yourself to me at the first class.

- 2019-12-29 15:30: the [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca) page for the course is up. The courses STAD29 and STA 1007 are crosslisted; I have merged the Quercus pages into one, so that you will all hand in assignments and see your grades in the same place. Likewise, this web page is for the whole course, and announcements here apply to everyone (unless I say otherwise). 

- 2019-12-11 19:00: corrected errors in the section on dates and times.
- 2019-11-25 11:00: Added section on dates and times to lecture notes.
- 2019-06-20 15:30: Lecture notes and code up, miscellaneous tinkering.
- 2019-05-28 11:30: a distant hello from the past.
