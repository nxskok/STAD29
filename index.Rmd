Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2019-12-29 15:35: lectures start in week 1 (January 8) and run Wednesdays 14:00-16:00 in HW 215. "Practicals" start in week 2 (January 13) and are Mondays 16:00-17:00 in BV 498. The practicals are like the tutorials in C32: I have booked a computer lab and will be there to help with anything course-related. I also have "ordinary" office hours in IC 471. 

  - If you are taking STA 1007, it helps if you know some R, but I will help you get up to speed if needed. I'd like it if you introduce yourself to me at the first class.

- 2019-12-29 15:30: the [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca) page for the course is up. The courses STAD29 and STA 1007 are crosslisted; I have merged the Quercus pages into one, so that you will all hand in assignments and see your grades in the same place. Likewise, this web page is for the whole course, and announcements here apply to everyone (unless I say otherwise).
