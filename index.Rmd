Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2020-01-21 16:30: on the agenda this week: logistic regression with a more-than-two-category response, for example high-medium-low rather than yes-no. There are two variations, depending on whether the response categories are ordered or not.

- 2020-01-21 16:25: draft [Assignment 4](a4.pdf), part of which I expect you'll be able to do after this week's lecture. Also long (sorry), but I wanted to make sure you had practice with as much as possible, to reduce the chance of surprises on the exams.

- 2020-01-20 22:30: first draft of [Assignment 3](a3.pdf), the first two questions of which you can do now. Yes, this is rather long, but you just had a short one. I am now working on assignment 4 (trying to stay ahead).

- 2020-01-19 17:00: tutorial, um, "practical", tomorrow for [Assignment 2](a2.pdf). 
I am working on Assignment 3, which is horrifically long (it has three questions to hand in right now, but I may shift one of them to assignment 4.)



- 2020-01-15 12:15: [My solutions to assignment 1](a1.pdf).

- 2020-01-15 11:15: on the agenda today: some more regression stuff, with some old ideas and some new ones; the start of logistic regression.

- 2020-01-15 11:00: a short [Assignment 2](a2.pdf), due next week. (It was longer, but I realized I might not get to everything in the original Assignment 2 today, so some of it is deferred to Assignment 3, which you can expect to be longer.) The question is on a "simple" logistic regression.

- 2020-01-13 15:50: the references to PASIAS in question 3 of assignment 1 appear to be to the wrong chapter, since they are meant to be practice for regression! Change chapter 13 to chapter 14, and you should be good.


- 2020-01-08 23:30: I spent too much of the evening cracking the problem with the lecture notes, but I think it is now fixed.

- 2020-01-08 16:30: [Assignment 1](a1.pdf) is good to go. Hand in questions 2 and 4. I am about to put it up on Quercus.

- 2020-01-08 16:25: I had a bit of trouble with the lecture notes. Now (finally) fixed.

- 2019-12-31 13:30: We get right down to business. Week 1's lecture will look at dates and times, and some regression stuff (beyond what we did in C32). 
Assignment 1 is based on the first lecture, and will be due the following Tuesday. Here is the
draft [Assignment 1](a1.pdf). As usual, if we don't get as far as all of that, I'll move what we don't look at in week 1 to a later assignment. 

- 2019-12-31 13:30: **For those taking STA 1007**: make sure you have access to R before we start. This could be having R installed on your computer, or having an account on R Studio Cloud. Pages 18--30, or pages 31--41, of [this](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf) will help. (Pick one.) It would also be good to follow along with [this](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/a0.pdf) and make sure you get the same things I did. Looking further ahead, the students in STAD29 have previously taken my course STAC32, so you might find [my C32 R lecture notes](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf) helpful. (That is, the same document from which the R access instructions came.) I am open to having R catchup sessions as necessary after lecture (if I have any voice left) for STA 1007 folks who need them. 

- 2019-12-29 15:35 edited 2020-01-08 10:45: lectures start in week 1 (January 8) and run Wednesdays 14:00-16:00 in HW 215. "Practicals" start in week 2 (January 13) and are Mondays 16:00-17:00 in BV 498. The practicals are like the tutorials in C32: I have booked a computer lab and I will be there to help with anything course-related. I also have "ordinary" office hours in IC 471, on Wednesday morning. The idea is if you have questions about the assignment, raise them in practical; if you have questions about the course material, ask me after class or in office hours. If you can't make it to the practical, I might also be available Monday afternoon after 13:00.

  - If you are taking STA 1007, it helps if you know some R, but I will help you get up to speed if needed. I'd like it if you introduce yourself to me at the first class.

- 2019-12-29 15:30: the [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca) page for the course is up. The courses STAD29 and STA 1007 are crosslisted; I have merged the Quercus pages into one, so that you will all hand in assignments and see your grades in the same place. Likewise, this web page is for the whole course, and announcements here apply to everyone (unless I say otherwise). 

- 2019-12-11 19:00: corrected errors in the section on dates and times.
- 2019-11-25 11:00: Added section on dates and times to lecture notes.
- 2019-06-20 15:30: Lecture notes and code up, miscellaneous tinkering.
- 2019-05-28 11:30: a distant hello from the past.
