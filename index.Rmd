Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, announcements etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2021-01-17 21:00: more [reading](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/learnonline/chapter/chapter-1/), this time about online learning.

- 2021-01-16 12:50: some [reading](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1349583012804005889) for you.

- 2021-01-15 21:45: there is an Announcement on Zoom about the Monday tutorial (which is really more like an office hour: bring questions if you have them in preparation for the assignment that is coming). 

  For my other course, I just wrote out a suggested weekly schedule, which seems a little like overkill for this course, but anyway, here's how you might arrange it:
  
  - Monday: if you have questions or confusions about the previous week's material, bring them to tutorial. (If everything is clear, no need to go to tutorial.)
  - Tuesday: pick a time between now and Thursday to work on the week's assignment, some number of hours like 4 or 5 (this will be like C32). Assignments will be open on Tuesday morning and due on Thursday at 11:59pm, and the first one is next week.
  - Wednesday: watch this week's lectures (if you can cope with two hours on one day; if not, split it over two days)
  - Thursday: work through the PASIAS problems for this week's lectures.
  - Friday: rest! (From this course at least.)

- 2021-01-14 20:45: there are now three ways to watch the lecture videos: 
  - using the video viewer on Quercus (as before)
  - downloading the videos and watching them offline using a video player like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). This is probably best if you have a shaky internet connection, or are a long way away, since this doesn't require your connection to stay up for any longer than the download takes.
  - on YouTube.
  
  The links to these are next to the lecture videos on Quercus.

- 2021-01-11 15:30: Lecture 1a (course outline) and Lecture 1b (first part of a review of regression) are now up on Quercus. There will be a Lecture 1c to complete the regression review. Assignment 1, when it comes out next week, will be on all of this.
- 2021-01-10 11:50: I corrected a few (small) errors in the [course outline](bOutline_slides.pdf).
- 2021-01-10 11:25: tutorials start on Monday Jan 18: that is to say, not tomorrow but in week 2. I am planning to record a short introduction today, and have the first week of actual material up by Wednesday. There will be an Assignment 1 on this, due on Jan 21. 
- 2021-01-10 11:15: STA 1007 is open on Quercus; its Quercus page should redirect to the D29 one, which is what you'll be using if you are registered in 1007.
- 2021-01-06 15:45: the [course outline](bOutline_slides.pdf) is now up to date.
- 2021-01-05 12:30: the [lecture notes](notes.html) are now arranged by section (to be somewhat less unwieldy).
- 2021-01-04 14:30: the course outline here will need editing to be suitable for this year's version of the course. I will do that later this week.
- 2021-01-04 12:00: here is how I plan to run STAD29 online this year (a lot like STAC32 was):
  - I will record something like 2 hours of lecture material each week and make it available to you on Quercus. In the before-times, this was one two-hour lecture a week, but I may break it up into smaller pieces.
  - there is one hour of tutorial a week, on Monday at 4:00pm (I think it is labelled as a Practical). This is the same idea as C32: bring questions to a Zoom meeting, and we can talk about them. I will put the Zoom link on Quercus. You will find the statistical material to be harder than it was in C32, so make sure to get clarification when you need. 
  - there will also be a Quercus discussion board available for questions. If it is something more personal, you can email me.
  - there will be weekly assignments; your grade is based on the best 8 out of the 10 of them. There isn't officially a project this time.

- 2020-04-29 12:30: If you plan to take your statistical skills into the business world, [this is a good read](https://medium.com/@ODSC/3-data-skills-to-get-hired-in-2020-73b4977bdc6f).
