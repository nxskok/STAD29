Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, announcements etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


## News (newest first)

- 2021-01-10 11:25: tutorials start on Monday Jan 18: that is to say, not tomorrow but in week 2. I am planning to record a short introduction today, and have the first week of actual material up by Wednesday. There will be an Assignment 1 on this, due on Jan 21. 
- 2021-01-10 11:15: STA 1007 is open on Quercus; its Quercus page should redirect to the D29 one, which is what you'll be using if you are registered in 1007.
- 2021-01-06 15:45: the [course outline](bOutline_slides.pdf) is now up to date.
- 2021-01-05 12:30: the [lecture notes](notes.html) are now arranged by section (to be somewhat less unwieldy).
- 2021-01-04 14:30: the course outline here will need editing to be suitable for this year's version of the course. I will do that later this week.
- 2021-01-04 12:00: here is how I plan to run STAD29 online this year (a lot like STAC32 was):
  - I will record something like 2 hours of lecture material each week and make it available to you on Quercus. In the before-times, this was one two-hour lecture a week, but I may break it up into smaller pieces.
  - there is one hour of tutorial a week, on Monday at 4:00pm (I think it is labelled as a Practical). This is the same idea as C32: bring questions to a Zoom meeting, and we can talk about them. I will put the Zoom link on Quercus. You will find the statistical material to be harder than it was in C32, so make sure to get clarification when you need. 
  - there will also be a Quercus discussion board available for questions. If it is something more personal, you can email me.
  - there will be weekly assignments; your grade is based on the best 8 out of the 10 of them. There isn't officially a project this time.

- 2020-04-29 12:30: If you plan to take your statistical skills into the business world, [this is a good read](https://medium.com/@ODSC/3-data-skills-to-get-hired-in-2020-73b4977bdc6f).
