Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for things course-related (notes, announcements etc., linked above) except for lecture videos, assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

- 2021-01-29 12:20: if you are thinking about switching to R Studio on your own computer (perhaps because you are running short of free hours on `rstudio.cloud`), the instructions for doing so are in the C32 notes: pages 15 and on of [this](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/running_R_slides.pdf). It is more work to get set up, but once you are up and running there are no limits on anything: run it as much as you like.

  - next week's Assignment 3 is up. It is rather long again, but one of the questions is really entirely straightforward (if you understand what you are doing, you ought not to have any trouble with it). 
  - since I've given you a heavy load so far, I want to give you a lighter week (in terms of lectures next week and the assignment following the week after). The material is called "analysis of variance revisited". This is a review of the anova stuff we did in C32, followed by some work on two-way anova and contrasts. Some of this might be familiar from B27 (or your equivalent course). I haven't recorded this yet; my daughter's room is cold today, so she is in my "recording studio" getting warmed up. Also, she has stolen my headphones. All of this is to say that I don't yet know how long that will come out, maybe an hour or so. The following section, on analysis of covariance, is short and not hard. Some of that will make up next week's lectures, and some of *that*, but not all of it, will feature in Assignment 4.
  - even though we started late, we still have a reading week, the same week it was: the week of February 15 (and thus after week 5, rather than the usual, after week 6). There will be no lectures to watch that week, and no assignment due. I might still have a tutorial if anyone wants to come by and chat. (It's not like any of us are going anywhere.) For me, the reading week doesn't get a number, so the course Week 6 is Feb 22-26. (If I number the reading week, the course appears to have 13 weeks and I get confused.)

- 2021-01-27 15:10: I have finished putting together (and shortening, not that you will believe it) an Assignment 3 for you on Lectures 3a and 3b. There are two longish questions again, because that's how things come out in this course. I will *try* to give you a less heavy Week 4, but I suspect there will still be a lot of things to ask about.

- 2021-01-26 12:30: Lecture 3b is up in the usual places (see the Week 3 Lecture videos page on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca)). Assignment 3 (next week) will be on the lecture 3a and 3b stuff. There is a little more than 2 times 50 minutes, so I will aim to give you a little less next week.

  - I just put up Assignment 2. This will be available to you tomorrow morning, and is due Thursday night. The nature of assignments in this course is that the questions have a largish number of parts, because there are usually several things to work through, some of which are easy and some of which will require some thinking. I have, I hope, given you a generous time limit this time. There are two questions this week, as there usually will be because there are typically two main ideas in the week's lectures that I want you to understand.
  - Lecture 3a is up already (I recorded it last week). It seems likely that Lecture 3b will go up tomorrow. This is on survival analysis. It might be a bit long, but I will record it and see how long it comes out. My tendency in this course is to go fairly slowly since there are a lot of ideas. You can always (at least on YouTube) speed up the playback if it is going too slowly for you.

- 2021-01-24 21:35: The assignment 1s have been marked and the grades are up. Here are [my solutions](a1.pdf). It looks as if most people did well, but be warned: this was kind of a warmup, and the next assignment you will probably find (a) longer and (b) more difficult in comparison to this one.

- 2021-01-20 17:05: I decided to record the third and last part of logistic regression today while I had everything set up (and the ideas were still fresh in my mind). You don't need to watch it until next week, however. The trouble with downloading the videos appears to be at my end; if that happens to you, the advice is the usual reboot, delete cookies etc. (For me, Brave doesn't like mymedia, Chrome was working until today, and Firefox is still working.) The next material after this is survival analysis; I would like to keep this together in one recording, but I fear it might go a bit long. I'll make a call  about that next week.

- 2021-01-20 14:20: the second part of this week's lecture is also up. There will be a third part of logistic regression, but I will save that for next week. (Thus, assignment 2 will be based on what you see there now.) At this moment, the direct download is not working, because of a problem with the mymedia site, but I will keep an eye on that.

- 2021-01-19 18:30: the first part of this week's lecture is up on Quercus. Look for a Week 2 Videos page.

- 2021-01-17 21:00: more [reading](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/learnonline/chapter/chapter-1/), this time about online learning.

- 2021-01-16 12:50: some [reading](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1349583012804005889) for you.

- 2021-01-15 21:45: there is an Announcement on Zoom about the Monday tutorial (which is really more like an office hour: bring questions if you have them in preparation for the assignment that is coming). 

  For my other course, I just wrote out a suggested weekly schedule, which seems a little like overkill for this course, but anyway, here's how you might arrange it:
  
  - Monday: if you have questions or confusions about the previous week's material, bring them to tutorial. (If everything is clear, no need to go to tutorial.)
  - Tuesday: pick a time between now and Thursday to work on the week's assignment, some number of hours like 4 or 5 (this will be like C32). Assignments will be open on Tuesday morning and due on Thursday at 11:59pm, and the first one is next week.
  - Wednesday: watch this week's lectures (if you can cope with two hours on one day; if not, split it over two days)
  - Thursday: work through the PASIAS problems for this week's lectures.
  - Friday: rest! (From this course at least.)

- 2021-01-14 20:45: there are now three ways to watch the lecture videos: 
  - using the video viewer on Quercus (as before)
  - downloading the videos and watching them offline using a video player like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). This is probably best if you have a shaky internet connection, or are a long way away, since this doesn't require your connection to stay up for any longer than the download takes.
  - on YouTube.
  
  The links to these are next to the lecture videos on Quercus.

- 2021-01-11 15:30: Lecture 1a (course outline) and Lecture 1b (first part of a review of regression) are now up on Quercus. There will be a Lecture 1c to complete the regression review. Assignment 1, when it comes out next week, will be on all of this.
- 2021-01-10 11:50: I corrected a few (small) errors in the [course outline](bOutline_slides.pdf).
- 2021-01-10 11:25: tutorials start on Monday Jan 18: that is to say, not tomorrow but in week 2. I am planning to record a short introduction today, and have the first week of actual material up by Wednesday. There will be an Assignment 1 on this, due on Jan 21. 
- 2021-01-10 11:15: STA 1007 is open on Quercus; its Quercus page should redirect to the D29 one, which is what you'll be using if you are registered in 1007.
- 2021-01-06 15:45: the [course outline](bOutline_slides.pdf) is now up to date.
- 2021-01-05 12:30: the [lecture notes](notes.html) are now arranged by section (to be somewhat less unwieldy).
- 2021-01-04 14:30: the course outline here will need editing to be suitable for this year's version of the course. I will do that later this week.
- 2021-01-04 12:00: here is how I plan to run STAD29 online this year (a lot like STAC32 was):
  - I will record something like 2 hours of lecture material each week and make it available to you on Quercus. In the before-times, this was one two-hour lecture a week, but I may break it up into smaller pieces.
  - there is one hour of tutorial a week, on Monday at 4:00pm (I think it is labelled as a Practical). This is the same idea as C32: bring questions to a Zoom meeting, and we can talk about them. I will put the Zoom link on Quercus. You will find the statistical material to be harder than it was in C32, so make sure to get clarification when you need. 
  - there will also be a Quercus discussion board available for questions. If it is something more personal, you can email me.
  - there will be weekly assignments; your grade is based on the best 8 out of the 10 of them. There isn't officially a project this time.

- 2020-04-29 12:30: If you plan to take your statistical skills into the business world, [this is a good read](https://medium.com/@ODSC/3-data-skills-to-get-hired-in-2020-73b4977bdc6f).
