<p>Welcome to the home page for STA 1007 / STAD29. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on <a href="http://q.utoronto.ca">Quercus</a>.</p>

<h2>News (newest first)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>2020-04-15 00:30: coming back to this course now that my other one is done. I got a question about interactions and spaghetti plots, and decided to make <a href="https://play.library.utoronto.ca/7bc15ce5627699acb2ede08c926346d1">this video</a> in response. If you have questions, send email. If yours is interesting, it might also get the video treatment.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-04-05 15:35: I have graded the projects (except for one which is late with my permission). There was some really nice work, and I was impressed with the variety of subject matter. I have made a few comments on each project. (If yours was a group project, the person who handed it in got the comments.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-04-02 11:40: This semester, you have until April 25 to drop the course, make it CR/NCR, etc, as appropriate. I normally release final exam marks and graded final exams as soon as they are available, but will not be doing so this time because you need to make these decisions before you receive, or can work out, your course grades. You will be receiving all your course grades after April 25.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-04-02 11:35: I draw your attention to <a href="https://hive.utsc.utoronto.ca/public/dean/academic%20administrators/DCD%202019-20/MEMO_Final_Exams_AcademicAdministrators_March2020.pdf">this document</a> from the Dean’s office. Items 7, 9, and possibly 8 may apply to you. (Item 8 only applies if you have already submitted a request to graduate.) <em>Do not ask me for clarification on these</em>. This is all I know about them.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-04-01 16:20: some thoughts about the final exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exam will look like an assignment. You will need to be running code and getting output, and handing that in on Quercus.</li>
<li>The exam is open-book, open Internet. You can use anything that you find on websites, but you may not obtain help from other people.</li>
<li>The coverage will be similar to past exams, but the style of question will be more like what you have seen on assignments.</li>
<li>Expect to see mainly material from after the midterm, but you may need ideas from before the midterm or even from C32.</li>
<li>There will be about four questions, intended to take you three hours.</li>
<li>The exam will be open on Quercus for 12 hours. That is to say, it will become available on April 17 at 10:00am and will be due on April 17 at 10:00pm (22:00). I am giving you extra time to allow for you being in a different time zone, having Internet problems, etc.</li>
<li>Late exams may be subject to a penalty. If you have accommodations from Accessability, your exam is due as many minutes after 10:00 as you have minutes of accommodation. (Such an exam may be indicated as “late” on Quercus, but is on time for me if it is within your accommodation.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2020-04-01 15:50:</p>
<ul>
<li>I just recorded the <a href="https://play.library.utoronto.ca/becfe181e320ed11d215d8373be517c6">final lecture</a> and sent it to Weboption.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>2020-03-25 22:20: the “at-home final exam” is under construction, and currently has two questions. I realize that I gave you guys a harder midterm than I might have done, so I plan to take it easy on you with the final in two ways: keeping the final exam weight the same as the original plan (in my other course I am reducing it), and trying to set a straightforward exam. “Straightforward”, however, still means that you need to know your stuff, and is not necessarily the same as “easy”.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-24 15:25: tomorrow’s <a href="https://play.library.utoronto.ca/c94149044df6611822ec59cfd0414dc3">lecture video</a>. This is only about an hour long, but it’s as far as I intend to go this week. (I might make an optional video about confirmatory factor analysis: we’ll see.) Next week is the last week; I have some stuff on frequency table analysis for then. (There is a piece in the lecture notes about time series, which I will skip.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-20 23:00: Not much to say today. I hope you are all keeping as well as possible, given the circumstances. I have periods where it is very hard to concentrate on anything; I expect you are having those too. Please look after yourselves. You have a lot to contribute to this world.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-19 14:50:</p>
<ul>
<li>re final “at-home” exam: I plan to give you something like 24 hours to get it done, even though there will only be three hours of work at maximum in it. It will be due at the end of our originally-scheduled exam time. I wanted to allow some extra time for internet problems, extra responsibilities, etc. So prepare to carve yourself out three hours or so to work on it. This is all subject to whatever happens between now and then, of course. Accessability students will have access to the exam earlier, or be able to hand it in later, according to their accommodations.</li>
<li>I don’t plan to enforce the “must get 50% on the final” this time, though I am guessing that everyone will get 50% anyway.</li>
<li>yesterday’s lecture, recorded in two parts, is now up on WebOption. (They spliced them together, so it’s one thing there.)</li>
<li>my solutions to <a href="a7.pdf">Assignment 7</a>.</li>
<li>the instructions, such as they are, for the (optional) project:
<ul>
<li>find a data set (eg. from your area of study) that enables analysis with something you have learned in this course, hopefully to learn something about the data that you would not have been able to find out otherwise</li>
<li>write a report on what you found, in the same style as for C32 (introduction, analysis, conclusion)</li>
<li>due by 11:59pm on Friday April 3.</li>
<li>That’s it. Very open-ended.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2020-03-18 15:45: I intend to be more generous than usual in accepting late assignments, so will hold off on putting up my solutions for a little bit. Going for a walk now. I could do with getting outside.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-18 15:40: “today’s lecture” in two parts: <a href="https://play.library.utoronto.ca/2fda5df114e0cad4fb206bf6ef2e4f9e">K-means clustering</a> and <a href="https://play.library.utoronto.ca/1757ef0aafba92a7c4218069871f026c">principal components</a>. Let me know if any problems accessing those. They are going to WebOption also, though there may be a delay getting them up there.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-17 16:05:</p>
<ul>
<li>in case there is any confusion: the project (if you choose to do it) and the “take-home final” are two different things. The project is and will remain optional. My intention in this course has been that projects are individual things, but I am willing to negotiate “small groups”, especially this time.</li>
<li>I usually allow the final exam mark to replace the midterm mark if it is higher, but I am unwilling to do that this time, because the midterm is our only invigilated assessment.</li>
<li>I plan to screencast “tomorrow afternoon’s lecture” tonight or tomorrow morning. I will probably do it in two pieces. There may be a delay before it goes up; I know WebOption is very busy right now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2020-03-16 20:30: I think my thoughts of yesterday will become official in some fashion. It looks as if we can have an assignment-like final (perhaps dressed up as a “take-home exam”). I have also opened up the Quercus discussion board, which you can use for anything non-personal related to this course, or respond to the comments of others. You can start new threads if you so desire. Assignments will indeed become best 6 out of 7, so there is no pressure to complete the last one if you are struggling to get it to work. WebOption will continue to work for courses that have it (such as this one), so you will find my screencasts there.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-15 20:55: some thoughts (which are only thoughts right now, nothing official here):</p>
<ul>
<li>I plan to run the course “asynchronously” the rest of the way. This means that you do not have to be anywhere, even virtually, at any particular time. I plan to record the lectures as screencasts and have the WebOption people put them up there, at or before the scheduled time. For now, I will field questions in email, but I am also open to trying Google Hangouts or similar. (There is also a thing on Quercus called Collaborate which I might be able to use.)</li>
<li>I imagine it’ll be some kind of online final exam, perhaps to be done in a manner similar to an assignment (but with time restriction). The University will be deciding this week what kind of things it will allow.</li>
<li>I messed up the “submit button” for assignment 7, but this is now fixed.</li>
<li>I am thinking of making the assignment grade “best 6 out of 7”, to give you a bit of help in the chaos of this week.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2020-03-15 20:45: Today’s message from the Dean is that there will be no in-person exams this semester. What that means in terms of exams is still unclear; those of you working with Accessability should continue to do so, and once the form of your exam is determined, they will determine any appropriate accommodations for you. We have a department meeting tomorrow in which (I hope) some things will be hashed out.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-12 11:30: I can’t remember what I was going to say here. Oh yeah, <a href="a6.pdf">my solutions to assignment 6</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-11 21:45: Assignment 7 appears to be good, and is now up on Quercus. One question on repeated measures (from last week), and one on discriminant analysis. Chapter 26 of <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">PASIAS</a> contains problems on cluster analysis (the second half of today and first half of next week). I am probably going to skip multidimensional scaling because I think PCA/factor analysis is more generally useful, and the stuff on log-linear models is a good way to finish the course. It looks as if we have three more weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-09 13:30: a draft <a href="a7.pdf">Assignment 7</a>. This will be the last assignment to hand in. I think you can do it now, though the first half of this week’s lecture may help you with one of the questions. This may undergo further editing.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-05 17:00: you should have email in your utoronto inbox from Crowdmark with your graded exam in it. Read your graded exam with <a href="midterm-20201.pdf">my solutions</a> to understand why you got the mark you did on each question.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-05 13:30: a final run of <a href="midterm-20201.pdf">my solutions</a>, including some actual answers that I liked (that all got full marks).</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-05 13:10: I decided to re-scale the midterm marks so that they are out of 68 rather than 73. This is, as I see it, an appropriately-sized compensation for the difficulty/question complication issue I mentioned below. As a result of this re-scaling, the marks have Q1 60%, median 70%, Q3 80%, which is about what I would expect. The marks are up on Quercus.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-05 12:30: 5(f) done. I have to go back and grade the early parts for the Accessability students (the parts I graded for everyone else, but I didn’t have the Accessability exams at that point).</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-05 11:40: I am thinking that the midterm was not too long as such, but it was (i) fairly hard and (ii) there were some complicated questions (I should learn to ask only one thing in each question part). The combination of hardness and complicated questions made the exam hard to finish in the time available. I will take a look at the marks when I have finished 5(f), and see if I need to make any adjustments. For the final exam, I certainly plan to simplify the questions. That means making them easier to understand, not necessarily easier to do! For example, 5(e) on the midterm asks you three things in one question part, which is too many. Also, I will think carefully about the hardness/time combination.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-05 11:40: 5(e) done. One part to go.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-04 12:40: <a href="a6.pdf">Assignment 6</a> is up on Quercus, due next Tuesday. I think you can probably do it now.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-03 16:30: 5(d) is done. I am getting slower and slower. I am out tonight, and tomorrow I have your lecture plus my other midterm in the evening, so I don’t expect to get much grading done then. Maybe Thursday morning I can finish it off.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-03 15:30: 5(c) done, rather slowly. The tea is apparently not helping much.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-03 14:40: 5(b) done.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-03 13:55: Back from class, and 5(a) done. It seems to be necessary to make tea now.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-03 11:45: 4(f) done. I have to go teach my other class now. (Their midterm is Wednesday night). I might get some more grading done this afternoon depending on whether any of them come to see me. (One of my TAs is having office hours, so they ought to go see her.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 22:20: 4(e) finally done. That is <em>definitely</em> where I stop for tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 21:30: 4(d) done. I think maybe one more part tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 20:50: 4(c) done, slowish but more good answers.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 17:50: 4(b) raced through. Home, then dinner, then back to work.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 17:20: 4(a) done. (A lot of good answers.) I’m hoping I can race through 4(b) before I head home.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 16:35: 3(f) done. On to question 4 shortly.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 16:00: 3(e) done. Slower, plus a visitor or two at my office.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 14:30: 3(d) done. I suspect I have some slow stuff coming up.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-02 14:00: back to work. 3(c) done. Need tea.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 22:54: a reminder that my <a href="midterm-20201.pdf">continually-updating solutions</a> are available. If you missed the midterm, for illness or some other reason, you would do well to write <a href="midterm-20201-q.pdf">this year’s midterm</a> as a practice exam. Here are <a href="midterm-20201-f.pdf">the figures</a> that go with it.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 22:35: 3(b) done. I am also done for tonight. I might make some progress tomorrow in the afternoon and during your tutorial time (there is no tutorial tomorrow). My other course has its midterm on Wednesday so tomorrow morning is for helping those students get prepared. I’m hoping I can snatch enough other time this week to get this exam done in the next few days.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 21:50: Crowdmark tells me that I got all the way through 3(a) in 15 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 21:05: question 2 done. It won’t all be as quick as this! However, I might set a speed record on 3(a).</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 20:35: 2(f) done. I plan to do 2(g) now and then take a break. After that, we see how much energy I have left.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 20:05: 2(e) done. I have decaf coffee on my desk, in the hope that this will keep me going for a while but not too long.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 18:50: 2(d) done. I must be getting faster, since that took less time to grade than my dinner is taking to cook.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 18:00: 2(c) done.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 17:20: walk, and 2(b), done. I think most of today’s soccer is done, so one less distraction tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 15:35: 2(a) done. I feel myself flagging. I think the walk is next.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 14:40: 1(e) done.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 13:15: 1(d) done. Lunch. I plan to take a walk on this nice sunny afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 12:25: 1(c) done. I may be checking the soccer scores now.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 11:15: breakfasted, and 1(b) done. There is soccer (and rugby league) happening, which I am trying not to get distracted by. My <a href="midterm-20201.pdf">solutions</a> will be added to with what I see while grading, as I go.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-03-01 09:35: it begins. 1(a) graded. I need breakfast.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-27 13:30: reminder: midterm exam is Saturday February 29, 17:00-19:00, in SW 309.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-26 22:00: three things:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="a5.pdf">My solutions to assignment 5</a>; also, <a href="a6.pdf">Assignment 6</a> is up, but not due until March 10.</li>
<li>I will eventually figure out how to share the “mixed models” code with you from the end of today’s class.</li>
<li>No tutorial next Monday since (i) you have no assignment due, (ii) I will be marking your midterms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2020-02-26 12:30: pre-exam office hours <em>Friday</em> 13:00-15:00 in my office.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-26 12:30: “campus remains open”.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-26 08:30: campus, it says, is open today, so as of now, today’s class goes ahead. I’m not sure about getting home afterwards, but that we’ll deal with later. (Check the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/campus-status-and-announcements">campus status page</a> at noon for any updates.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-25 14:20: on the old exams page, it looks as if the column “exams” was linking to the wrong files, which I have now fixed. This column should be questions without answers, for practicing on (and then you can look at the copies in the Answers column to see how well you did).</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-24 21:10: on the agenda for this week: multivariate analysis of variance (1st half) plus repeated measures (2nd half). This material is not on the midterm, but you can and should expect to see it on the final.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-24 21:00: <a href="a6.pdf">Assignment 6</a> has gained a question, on some of the material we will do in this week’s class. The assignment isn’t due until Mar 10, so there is no rush, but you would do well to look through it in case there is anything there that might be on the midterm.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-21 16:30: exam sent for printing. It came out to 9 pages after I added space for you to write your answers. (The last page is blank, in case you need extra space for writing.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-21 15:00: I’ve been spending reading week working on your midterm. The coverage is whatever we did up to and including the week before reading week (which might include some of the material on <a href="a6.pdf">Assignment 6</a>.) The exam has five questions worth a total of 73 points (there are 30 question parts altogether). I am currently adding spaces for you to write onto the pages of the exam.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-12 21:00: the course <a href="https://lecturecast.utsc.utoronto.ca/?id=60a56cc8cc">WebOption page</a> now features a lengthened Lecture 5 (the hour that Nnenna presented in class, plus the extra hour she recorded afterwards), as well as Lecture 6 (me, today). This gives you what you need to tackle Assignment 5.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-12 12:00 edited 12:45: one of our number has discovered a problem with the 2018 midterm: the last two plots are supposed to be survival curves and an interaction plot, and they are rather obviously not that. I need to figure out what happened. (They were correct on the original exam, that I know.) I have now fixed this. It turned out that I had failed to install some packages since my move to R 3.6, but this was showing up in an odd way.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-12 10:45: Nnenna recorded the second hour of her lecture from last week, the piece on two-factor ANOVA with simple effects, which I am told “will be going up later this afternoon”. So today I will kick off with contrasts (starting on page 306). I am skipping the material on equivalence and noninferiority. After that, we look at analysis of covariance. I have an assignment question on analysis of covariance, but I’m not sure what to do with it yet. Maybe I can squeeze a shortened version of it onto assignment 5.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-09 14:30: even though there is no assignment due, I will still be in BV 498 on Monday at 4, in case you have any questions for me about the material covered during my absence.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-09 14:00: I also have an <a href="a6.pdf">early draft</a> of Assignment 6, which will be due on March 10 (ie. after the midterm). This will gain a question on MANOVA and/or repeated measures, which we will probably see the week after reading week. I have to decide whether the material in Assignment 6 is on the midterm or not. I’ll let you know about that. (If it is not, it will <em>certainly</em> be on the final. Be warned.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-09 13:30: I had some more email from students making the reasonable point that if last week’s second hour goes up on Monday, as it will, that is not enough time to complete even the shortened assignment 5 by Tuesday night. So I am giving you an extension on Assignment 5. Extending it by one week will take us into reading week, so Assignment 5 will now be due on <em>February 25</em>. Count yourselves lucky. In compensation for that, we go back to two questions (I might even go to three, depending on how far we get in class this week). Watch Nnenna’s second hour of lecture (up on Monday) to prepare yourself for question 2, and the first hour of my lecture this week will prepare you for question 3. <a href="a5.pdf">Here</a> are things as they stand now.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-08 17:15: OK, so I think I am sorted out. Here is the now shortened <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a> with only one question, up on Quercus. The last two parts are about simple effects; if you haven’t done those yet, <em>let me know</em> and I’ll move those off assignment 5 (and onto the beginning of assignment 6, which would then have three questions, the first being short). Here also is a <a href="a6.pdf">draft Assignment 6</a>. It’s difficult to coordinate a course when you’re not teaching it! Let’s hope that we can get organized this week.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-08 16:45: I just checked the WebOption page for our course, and “Lecture 5”, from Wednesday, is only one hour long. Since we have not reached the material on analysis of covariance yet, I will move that question from assignment 5 to assignment 6, so your assignment this week only has one question on it, and I now have a draft assignment 6 that I can post. (The questions on assignment 6 will be doable after this week’s lecture, as plans stand now.) I <em>hope</em> that you can manage the batteries question, which includes simple effects; this material is slides 285–289 of the lecture notes. (I apologize for getting out of sync, if I have.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-07 15:30: I met with Nnenna this afternoon to hear about where she was at with you. She finished at 3 last Wednesday (because she had to go downtown) and so the lecture that’s up is only one hour long. She will be recording the second hour today. The second hour includes analysis of covariance, which appears in question 3 of the current assignment. This is supposed to go up tonight, so I will leave it on the assignment for now. If it turns out not to go up tonight, I will move it to the next assignment. (For those wanting a head start on this stuff, look at pages 276–290 of the lecture notes.) I plan to skip the stuff on equivalence and noninferiority, and kick off next week with contrasts, page 306.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-06 10:30: my <a href="a4.pdf">solutions to Assignment 4</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-06 10:00: the <a href="a5.pdf">corrected assignment 5</a> with the proper link to the batteries data is up on Quercus. I am keeping an eye on whether you will have a fair chance to work on question 3 (I know you only had a one-hour lecture) and will postpone it to a future assignment if I think you won’t have enough time to think about it.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-06 09:45: back home (and, somewhat, awake). I made a mistake with the batteries data file in the current assignment: the correct link is <a href="batteries.txt">here</a>. I will fix up the assignment file on Quercus shortly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Aside: while I was in England and posting here, I had to remember to subtract five hours from the time there when I typed the timestamps! That explains the early morning timestamps on some of them. I don’t <em>actually</em> get up that early!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2020-02-04 12:00: Nnenna has another commitment later in the afternoon downtown tomorrow, so her plan is to lecture for <em>one</em> hour tomorrow, and then video-record the second hour later. I will pick up next week from wherever she gets to.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-04 11:55: the issue with <code>dplyr</code> on R Studio Cloud seems to have been fixed. (I successfully installed the whole tidyverse on a new project there, using dodgy English hotel wifi, so if it works there, it should work for you.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-03 11:00: I (Ken) will be back next week. Booked my flight back today.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-03 10:55: draft <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a>, to be doable after Wednesday’s class. Let me know if it isn’t.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-03 06:45: my <a href="slides_d29.pdf">lecture notes</a> had some things off the side for predictions with survival analysis. This has now been fixed. The slides now numbered 219–221 might give you a hint for the assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-02-01 11:48: if you are in the habit of starting a new project for each assignment, you might run into trouble doing that this time, since there is an issue with installing <code>dplyr</code> at the moment (<code>dplyr</code> is part of the tidyverse). This usually happens when there is a new version of the package. Until R Studio Cloud obtains a “cached” copy of it (at which point it will install properly), it has to install it from source code, which means compiling some C code, except that <code>dplyr</code> is big, so it won’t work. The fix for now is to create a new notebook in one of your old projects, one in which you successfully installed the <code>tidyverse</code>. I apologize if this messes up your organization. (I used to suggest creating a new project for each piece of work, but maybe it’s better to have one project called Assignments and have a new <em>notebook</em> in there for each assignment.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-31 11:00: my <a href="a3.pdf">solutions to assignment 3</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-31 10:55: I made a small error on <a href="a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a> which may confuse you when you do it. Use these slightly-modified questions (also going up instead of the previous file of questions on Quercus).</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-30 07:00: my solutions to assgt 3 taken down temporarily; will go back up later.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-30 06:00: assignment 3 is now closed, and assignment 4 is now up (on the material in yesterday’s class). Remember what I said in C32: don’t expect assignments to be extended because you cannot access software: <em>it is up to you to allow enough time</em>. The first problems on <code>rstudio.cloud</code> were noted midday on January 28. If you leave an assignment until late, you are <em>gambling</em> that you will be able to finish it in time. For the next assignment, <em>start it early</em> (you have everything now that you need to do it), and be prepared to <em>use R Studio on your own computer</em>. The instructions for that are <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf">here</a>, starting at page 31.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-28 17:00: I am hearing about R Studio outages, and I cannot connect myself. We’ll allow assignment 3’s to reach us up to 6:00pm tomorrow. I’ll put up my solutions after that.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-28 08:30: I am temporarily in England. Nnenna Asidianya will be teaching in my absence. Keep an eye on Quercus for announcements from her.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-22 16:15: Assignment 3 is up on Quercus, due next week Tuesday.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-22 12:50: scheduled midterm time is Saturday, February 29, 2020 17:00-19:00 in SW309.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-22 12:45: <a href="a2.pdf">My solutions to assignment 2</a></p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-21 16:30: on the agenda this week: logistic regression with a more-than-two-category response, for example high-medium-low rather than yes-no. There are two variations, depending on whether the response categories are ordered or not.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-21 16:25: draft <a href="a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a>, part of which I expect you’ll be able to do after this week’s lecture. Also long (sorry), but I wanted to make sure you had practice with as much as possible, to reduce the chance of surprises on the exams.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-20 22:30: first draft of <a href="a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a>, the first two questions of which you can do now. Yes, this is rather long, but you just had a short one. I am now working on assignment 4 (trying to stay ahead).</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-19 17:00: tutorial, um, “practical”, tomorrow for <a href="a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a>. I am working on Assignment 3, which is horrifically long (it has three questions to hand in right now, but I may shift one of them to assignment 4.)</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-15 12:15: <a href="a1.pdf">My solutions to assignment 1</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-15 11:15: on the agenda today: some more regression stuff, with some old ideas and some new ones; the start of logistic regression.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-15 11:00: a short <a href="a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a>, due next week. (It was longer, but I realized I might not get to everything in the original Assignment 2 today, so some of it is deferred to Assignment 3, which you can expect to be longer.) The question is on a “simple” logistic regression.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-13 15:50: the references to PASIAS in question 3 of assignment 1 appear to be to the wrong chapter, since they are meant to be practice for regression! Change chapter 13 to chapter 14, and you should be good.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-08 23:30: I spent too much of the evening cracking the problem with the lecture notes, but I think it is now fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-08 16:30: <a href="a1.pdf">Assignment 1</a> is good to go. Hand in questions 2 and 4. I am about to put it up on Quercus.</p></li>
<li><p>2020-01-08 16:25: I had a bit of trouble with the lecture notes. Now (finally) fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-31 13:30: We get right down to business. Week 1’s lecture will look at dates and times, and some regression stuff (beyond what we did in C32). Assignment 1 is based on the first lecture, and will be due the following Tuesday. Here is the draft <a href="a1.pdf">Assignment 1</a>. As usual, if we don’t get as far as all of that, I’ll move what we don’t look at in week 1 to a later assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-31 13:30: <strong>For those taking STA 1007</strong>: make sure you have access to R before we start. This could be having R installed on your computer, or having an account on R Studio Cloud. Pages 18–30, or pages 31–41, of <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf">this</a> will help. (Pick one.) It would also be good to follow along with <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/a0.pdf">this</a> and make sure you get the same things I did. Looking further ahead, the students in STAD29 have previously taken my course STAC32, so you might find <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf">my C32 R lecture notes</a> helpful. (That is, the same document from which the R access instructions came.) I am open to having R catchup sessions as necessary after lecture (if I have any voice left) for STA 1007 folks who need them.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-29 15:35 edited 2020-01-08 10:45: lectures start in week 1 (January 8) and run Wednesdays 14:00-16:00 in HW 215. “Practicals” start in week 2 (January 13) and are Mondays 16:00-17:00 in BV 498. The practicals are like the tutorials in C32: I have booked a computer lab and I will be there to help with anything course-related. I also have “ordinary” office hours in IC 471, on Wednesday morning. The idea is if you have questions about the assignment, raise them in practical; if you have questions about the course material, ask me after class or in office hours. If you can’t make it to the practical, I might also be available Monday afternoon after 13:00.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are taking STA 1007, it helps if you know some R, but I will help you get up to speed if needed. I’d like it if you introduce yourself to me at the first class.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-12-29 15:30: the <a href="http://q.utoronto.ca">Quercus</a> page for the course is up. The courses STAD29 and STA 1007 are crosslisted; I have merged the Quercus pages into one, so that you will all hand in assignments and see your grades in the same place. Likewise, this web page is for the whole course, and announcements here apply to everyone (unless I say otherwise).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-11 19:00: corrected errors in the section on dates and times.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-25 11:00: Added section on dates and times to lecture notes.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-06-20 15:30: Lecture notes and code up, miscellaneous tinkering.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-05-28 11:30: a distant hello from the past.</p></li>
